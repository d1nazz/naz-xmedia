# naz-xmedia WEB

Lightweight Vite + React + TypeScript starter with Tailwind and shadcn-style components.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Useful commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (port 8080)
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

Notes

- This repo had missing UI component files initially. I added minimal stubs so the project builds. Replace them with your intended components when ready.
